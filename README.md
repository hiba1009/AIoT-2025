## 🌟 The Complete AIoT Journey

### **Phase 1: Machine Learning Foundations (TP1-TP2)**
*From Cloud to Constraints*

The journey begins in the **cloud environment**, where computational resources are abundant and we can focus on understanding ML fundamentals without hardware limitations.

#### [TP1: Fire Alarm Detection with Classical ML](TP1/TP1.md)
**Objective**: Build binary classification models for IoT fire detection systems

We start with the most fundamental question in AIoT: *Can we predict dangerous conditions from sensor data?* Using environmental sensor readings (temperature, humidity, gas concentrations), you'll implement:

- **Logistic Regression**: A lightweight, interpretable baseline model
- **XGBoost**: A powerful ensemble method for comparison

**Key Learning**: Understanding the trade-off between model complexity and performance - a theme that will echo throughout the entire course.

#### [TP2: Optimization & Deployment Analysis](TP2/TP2.md)
**Objective**: Measure computational footprint and evaluate hardware feasibility

Now comes the critical transition from **theory to reality**. You'll discover that a model working perfectly on Kaggle might be completely unsuitable for an ESP32. This TP introduces:

- **ML Pipelines**: Encapsulating preprocessing and inference
- **Resource Measurement**: Model size (KB), inference time (ms), memory footprint
- **The ESP32 Question**: *Can this actually run on a microcontroller?*

**Critical Insight**: The best model isn't the most accurate - it's the one that can actually deploy within your constraints (512 KB SRAM, 240 MHz processor).

---

### **Phase 2: Embedded Machine Learning (TP3-TP4)**
*Bridging Cloud and Edge*

Having measured our models, we now face the challenge: **How do we move ML from powerful servers to tiny microcontrollers?**

#### [TP3: Manual Deployment on Arduino](TP3/TP3_Logistic_Arduino.md)
**Objective**: Manually implement Logistic Regression on Arduino Uno

This is where theory meets silicon. You'll extract model parameters (weights, biases, scaling factors) from Python and manually implement the inference pipeline in C++:

```
Raw sensor data → Standardization → Linear combination → Sigmoid → Prediction
```

**Breakthrough Moment**: Running your first ML inference on a $5 microcontroller and realizing that AI doesn't require powerful GPUs - it requires smart engineering.

#### [TP4: Communication Architectures for AIoT](TP4/TP4.md)
**Objective**: Design distributed ML systems using MQTT and HTTP/REST

Real IoT systems rarely perform inference in isolation. This TP introduces **edge-cloud hybrid architectures**:

- **MQTT Pub/Sub**: ESP32 publishes sensor data → Python subscriber runs ML inference → Decision sent back
- **HTTP/REST Alternative**: Request/response pattern for comparison

**System Design Insight**: Sometimes the best deployment strategy is **not** running ML on the device - it's about choosing the right architecture for your use case (latency, power, connectivity).

---

### **Phase 3: Deep Learning for Edge AI (TP5-TP8)**
*From Simple Models to Neural Networks*

Classical ML has limits. For complex tasks like image recognition, we need **deep learning** - but how do we fit neural networks on microcontrollers?

#### [TP5: Neural Networks for Image Classification](TP5/TP5.md)
**Objective**: Compare MLP and CNN architectures on Fashion-MNIST

You'll discover why **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** are superior for images:

- **MLP**: Treats pixels as independent features (784 inputs)
- **CNN**: Learns spatial hierarchies (edges → patterns → objects)

**Performance vs. Efficiency**: CNNs achieve higher accuracy with fewer parameters than MLPs - a crucial lesson for embedded deployment.

#### [TP6: TensorFlow Lite & Quantization](TP6/TP6.md)
**Objective**: Convert Keras models to TinyML using quantization

This is where **TensorFlow Lite** bridges the gap between training frameworks and microcontrollers:

- **Quantization Magic**: Convert Float32 (4 bytes) → Int8 (1 byte) = **75% size reduction**
- **Trade-off**: ~2% accuracy loss for 4x smaller model and 2-4x faster inference

**Reality Check**: Even with quantization, you must carefully design models to fit in 512 KB SRAM.

#### [TP7: On-Device CNN Inference](TP7/TP7.md)
**Objective**: Deploy TensorFlow Lite model on ESP32-S3

The full pipeline comes together:

1. Train CNN in Keras
2. Convert to `.tflite` with Int8 quantization
3. Convert model to C header file using `xxd`
4. Integrate with TensorFlow Lite Micro interpreter
5. Run real-time inference on Fashion-MNIST images

**Technical Depth**: Understanding tensor arenas, memory allocation, and the TFLite Micro runtime.

#### [TP8: Distributed Inference Architecture](TP8/TP8.md)
**Objective**: Offload ML inference from ESP32 to Python via MQTT

A practical design pattern for production systems:

- **ESP32**: Data acquisition and publishing (low power)
- **Python Backend**: Heavy ML computation (high performance)
- **MQTT Bridge**: Asynchronous, scalable communication

**Architectural Decision**: When to run ML on-device vs. offload to the cloud? Consider: latency, power, privacy, connectivity.

### **Phase 4: MLOps & Production Edge AI (TP9-TP10)**
*From Prototype to Production*

The final phase introduces **MLOps (Machine Learning Operations)** - the practices and tools needed to build production-ready Edge AI systems.

#### [TP9: Edge Impulse MLOps Platform](TP9/TP9.md)
**Objective**: Build Arabic Keyword Spotting model using a professional MLOps platform

**Edge Impulse** revolutionizes TinyML development by providing:

- **End-to-End Pipeline**: Data collection → Feature engineering → Training → Deployment
- **Automated Optimization**: Automatic quantization and hardware-specific tuning
- **Audio DSP Blocks**: MFCC/MFE feature extraction (no manual implementation needed)
- **One-Click Export**: Generate ready-to-use Arduino libraries

**The Arabic KWS Project**: Train a model to recognize Arabic commands ("تمكين" - Enable, "تعطيل" - Disable) that will deploy on ESP32-S3. This mirrors how Google Assistant and Alexa work - a tiny wake-word detector runs locally on the device before sending data to the cloud.

**MLOps Concepts Learned**:
- Data versioning and management
- Experiment tracking (comparing MFCC vs MFE, CNN vs Transfer Learning)
- Automated quantization and deployment
- Model performance monitoring

#### [TP10: Real-Time Audio Inference System](TP10/TP10.md)
**Objective**: Deploy Arabic KWS model with MQTT audio streaming

The final project brings everything together in a sophisticated real-time system:

**System Architecture**:
```
Microphone (Python) → MQTT Broker → ESP32 (Wokwi) → Edge Impulse Model → Real-time Predictions
```

**Technical Challenges Solved**:
- **Circular Buffering**: Handle irregular network packet arrival with FIFO buffer
- **Audio Slicing**: Stream audio in 1024-sample chunks to prevent memory overflow
- **Continuous Inference**: Run classifier in real-time on streaming audio
- **Simulation Workaround**: Using MQTT to simulate I2S microphone in Wokwi

**The Complete Pipeline**:
1. Audio captured (browser/file) → Python dispatcher
2. Audio sliced and published via MQTT (1024 samples/packet)
3. ESP32 receives packets, writes to circular buffer
4. Edge Impulse model reads from buffer, extracts MFCC features
5. CNN classifier predicts: "enable", "disable", "unknown", or "noise"
6. Predictions displayed on LCD in real-time

## 🔑 Key Concepts Mastered

### 💡 The AIoT Design Triangle

Every AIoT system must balance three constraints:
